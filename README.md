🌍 Day 1 — Interactive Geo-Dashboard: District Headquarters of Jammu & Kashmir

As part of my Geo-Analytics Challenge (Day 1), I developed an interactive spatial dashboard to visualize the district headquarters of Jammu & Kashmir using open-source geospatial tools in Python.

🧭 Project Overview

This dashboard integrates district boundary GeoJSON layers with point-based district HQ locations, enabling both spatial visualization and data-driven insights. Users can explore division-level (Jammu / Kashmir) data interactively through the web interface.

🔧 Key Technologies

Python, Pandas — Data management and preprocessing

Folium — Geospatial visualization and mapping

Dash & Plotly — Interactive dashboard framework

GeoJSON — Boundary integration for administrative layers

📊 Features Implemented

Division-wise filter to toggle between Jammu and Kashmir regions

Interactive map with district markers, tooltips, and cluster visualization

GeoJSON boundary overlays for accurate district representation

Linked Pie and Scatter charts for analytical insights

Seamless integration of Folium within Dash using Iframe

🎯 Outcomes

This exercise strengthened my understanding of combining geospatial data visualization with analytical dashboards. It also laid the groundwork for upcoming modules focusing on AI-based remote sensing, real-time data feeds, and predictive insights.
